# Chat-Application-Project
Chatting is one way to overcome geographical barriers and connect people and ideas through technology.
Although the technology has been around for a while, only recently has it been accepted.
With the ability to send and receive messages in real-time, a chat application facilitates communication with individuals located anywhere in the world.
Through customized messaging features, users of a real-time chat software can have the same engaging and energetic discussions as they would in person. You might have used WhatsApp or Telegram for chatting with your family members, or friends.
